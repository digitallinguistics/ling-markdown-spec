## Introduction

Linguistics-flavored markdown is a dialect of markdown with a few extensions specific to creating documents in linguistics. It is mostly a superset of markdown, except for how single asterisks are handled, which differs from standard markdown implementation.

Here are some additional resources for learning the basics of markdown:

- **[Markdown Guide][md-guide]:** A reference guide that explains how to use markdown.
- **[Markdown Specification][md-spec]:** The original markdown specification.
- **[Awesome Markdown][awesome-md]:** A collection of useful markdown resources.
